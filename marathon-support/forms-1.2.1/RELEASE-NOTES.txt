                            Version 1.2.1
                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This maintenance release fixes bugs when using multiple class loaders
    to use multiple Forms versions in a single application (where most
    applications load only a single Forms version). This version also
    comes with improved tutorial sources, and it ships a new feature
    in the source code extras that can automatically associate added 
    components with labels that have mnemonics, see the PanelBuilder2.
    
    
BUGS FIXED

    o Issue 63: Class Leak due to UIManager.addPropertyChangeListener()
    o Issue 64: ClassCastException when using different ClassLoaders.
    

OTHER CHANGES

    o AbstractFormBuilder#add(Component, CellConstraints) can be
      overridden in subclasses.
    o Added PanelBuilder2 to the source code extras. It provides
      a feature that shall be moved to the PanelBuilder in the next
      major version: associate a focusable component with a previously
      added label that has a mnemonic. This feature will be moved
      to the core PanelBuilder in the next release.
    o FormUtils#clearLookAndFeelBasedCaches is public.
      
      
ROADMAP

    Forms 2.0 
    o API clarification and API extensions.
    o Bug fixing - even if the fix affects the layout.
    o Make DLU a general unit.
    o Change the default unit conversion algorithm.
    
    Future version
    o Extend the tutorial.
    o Move to Java 5.

                           JGoodies Forms
                            Version 1.2.0
                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This update fixes bugs and brings several major improvements.
    It is binary incompatible with previous versions of the Forms;
    however the API changes don't affect typical application code.
    
    Version 1.2 is visually compatible with previous versions.
    Layouts specified with 1.0.7 or 1.1 are the same in 1.2. 
    The Forms 1.2 offer syntax extensions, layout variables,
    and rarely used code has been removed.
    
    
CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE COMPATIBILITY

    o Removed the deprecated FormFactory#createColumnLayout methods.
    o Added #encode() to the Size interface.
          
      
NEW FEATURES

    o New syntax for encoded column and row specification:
      - layout variables, see the LayoutMap class comment for details.
      - bounded sizes
          [<constant size>,<logical size>]   // lower bound
          [<logical size>,<constant size>]   // upper bound
          [<constant>,<logical>,<constant>]  // lower and upper bound
          for example [30dlu, pref], [pref, 30dlu], [10dlu, pref, 30dlu]
      - multiplier "5*(p, 3dlu), p"
      - prototype strings "p, '123-456-789', p"
      - accepts string encodings with whitespace before a comma,
        for example "pref , pref"
    o Sizes#setDefaultUnit(Unit) allows to set the unit that is used
      for constant sizes without explicit unit, e.g. "21".
      As of the Forms 1.2 the default is still ConstantSize.PIXEL.
      Sizes.setDefaultUnit(null) sets it to Dialog Units (DLU).
    o Borders#DLU21_BORDER, Sizes#DLUX21, Sizes#DLUY21.
    o ColumnSpec#createGap(ConstantSize), RowSpec#createGap(ConstantSize).
    o Added DefaultFormBuilder#setDefaultRowSpec.
    o DefaultComponentFactory#setTextAndMnemonic is public.
    o ColumnSpec#encode, RowSpec#encode, and Size#encode return
      a parseable encoded string specification.
    o ButtonBarBuilder2. It builds betters button bars
      and has a simpler API than the ButtonBarBuilder.
    o FormLayout can honor or ignore the component visibility. Added 
      FormLayout#setHonorsVisibility(boolean) for the container level and
      FormLayout#setHonorsVisibility(Component, Boolean) for a
      component-specific setting that overrides the container default.
    o ButtonStackBuilder(FormLayout, JPanel)


LAYOUT VARIABLES
    
    Layout variables are intended to improve the layout consistency
    in GUIs with many views. And they can improve the readability.
    Variables are used in the encoded column and row specifications.
    They start with the '$' character, for example you can write:
    new FormLayout("pref, $lcgap, pref, $rgap, pref",
                   "p, $lgap, p, $myGap1, p, ${my gap}")
    where $lcgap, $rgap, $lgap are default variables, and $myGap1 
    and ${my gap} are custom variables.
    
    LayoutMaps build a chain; each LayoutMap has an optional parent map.
    The root is defined by LayoutMap#getRoot(). Application-wide variables 
    should be defined in the root LayoutMap. If you want to override
    application-wide variables locally, obtain a LayoutMap using 
    new LayoutMap(), configure it, and provide it as argument to the
    FormLayout, ColumnSpec, and RowSpec constructors/factory methods.
    
    
BUGS FIXED

    o DefaultUnitConverter ignores changes of the default dialog font
      when computing the global dialog base units.
    o BoundedSize constructor accepts null lower and upper bound.
    o Borders#createEmptyBorder accepts null values.
    o Parser accepts column specs without commas.
        
    
OTHER CHANGES

    o Borders#createEmptyBorder returns a Border that benefits
      from the optimization in JComponent#getInsets(Insets).
    o Added tests for the new syntax.
    o Updated download address.

                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This update fixes minor bugs and comes with a few API changes.
    It is binary incompatible with previous versions of the Forms,
    however the API changes won't affect typical application code.
    
    This version is primarily intended to deliver the API changes
    and tiny improvements that have been made since version 1.0.7.
    I've decided to make smaller steps, and to release updates more 
    frequently. On the other hand, some changes planned for 1.1 
    have been deferred to future versions.
    
    
CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE COMPATIBILITY

    o Removed deprecated builder constructors:
          AbstractFormBuilder(Container, FormLayout)
          PanelBuilder(JPanel, FormLayout)
          I15dPanelBuilder(JPanel, FormLayout, ResourceBundle)
          DefaultFormBuilder(JPanel, FormLayout)
          DefaultFormBuilder(JPanel, FormLayout, ResourceBundle)
          
      
NEW FEATURES

    o Added PanelBuilder#setBackground and #setOpaque.
    o Added AbstractI15dPanelBuilder to reduce the effort required
      to build internationalized builders for ResourceMaps.
    o Added a debug feature for broken localizations, 
      see the class comment in AbstractI15dPanelBuilder.
    o Added CellConstraints#rc, #rcw, #rchw
    o Added the constructor FormLayout(ColumnSpec[])
    o DefaultComponentFactory is non-final.
    o BoundedSize is public, as well as its sole constructor.
    o Added BoundedSize#getBasis, #getLowerBound, #getUpperBound.
    o Added ConstantSize#getValue, #getUnit.
    o Public ConstantSize(double, Unit) and ConstantSize(int, Unit).
    o FormLayout.Measure is public.
    
    
BUGS FIXED

    o Issue 38: Layout ignores default size if it is bounded
    o Issue 46: DLU size not updated on look&feel changes
    o Issue 54: Utilities#computeIsLafAqua uses name not id
    o Added a missing 'I' in I15dPanelBuilder#add15dTitle(String, String)
        
    
OTHER CHANGES

    o ANT build creates a Maven bundle.
    o Improved DefaultComponentFactory#createSeparator(JLabel) docs.
    o Slightly improved the DefaultFormBuilder tutorial examples.
    o Source code improvements.
    o Marked the FormFactory#createColumnLayout methods as deprecated.
      These will be removed from version 1.2.

                    JGoodies Forms, Version 1.0.4
                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This maintenance release fixes bugs, comes with a simpler API,
    and provides more JavaDoc examples for frequently used methods.
    
    
API INCOMPATIBILITIES

    o ColumnSpec and RowSpec are now immutable. This won't affect
      the typical Forms usage, but may affect visual builder tools.
    o Removed method ButtonStackBuilder#addGriddedNarrow(JComponent)
    
    
VISUAL INCOMPATIBILITIES
  
    o In rare cases the container size may be smaller than before. 
      Bug #4 has been fixed (see below). In 1.0.4 the container
      will be expanded only if components span cols/rows that can grow.
      In 1.0.3 the container could be expanded if *any* col/row grows.
      So some wrong 1.0.3 container expansions won't happen in 1.0.4.
    

NEW FEATURES

    o Added the CellConstraints#xyw method set.
    o Added FormLayoutUtils to the Extras.
    
    
BUGS FIXED

    o DefaultUnitConverter#setDefaultDialogFont throws NPE.
    o DefaultUnitConverter#setAverageCharacterWidthTestString throws NPE.
    o Invalid sample code in PanelBuilder JavaDocs.
    o (Bug #4) In some cases components that span multiple columns/rows 
      can expand the container size, although none of the spanned
      columns/rows are allowed to grow. 
    
    
OTHER CHANGES

    o Extended and corrected JavaDoc class comments.
    o Added examples to the JavaDocs of frequently used methods.
    o Refreshed README and FAQ
    o Refreshed whitepaper to demonstrate CellConstraints#xyw.
    o Added two HTML pages: Visual Builders and References.

                    JGoodies Forms, Version 1.0.3
                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This maintenance release contains new core classes, adds methods,
    and comes with improved JavaDocs and an extended tutorial and FAQ.
    The DefaultFormBuilder has been moved from the extras to the core.

    Also, the support for the Mac OS X has been improved significantly:
    the DefaultComponentFactory has been adjusted for the Aqua look&feel, 
    the new MacLayoutStyle describes the Mac and Aqua styles guide lines,
    and the ButtonBarBuilder and ButtonBarFactory now honor a button order.
    
    
VISUAL INCOMPATIBILITIES

    On the Mac OS X platform Forms 1.0.3 changes the button order;
    other platforms are not affected. In most cases this will improve 
    the user experience of your applications. It is recommended to
    check your ButtonBarBuilder invocation to use a fixed left to right
    order where necessary.
    
    ButtonBarBuilder methods that create sequences of buttons now honor 
    the LayoutStyle's button order. On Mac OS X this is right to left.
    Builder methods that add individual buttons are not affected.
    See the ButtonOrderExample in the tutorial for details on how to
    use or ignore the LayoutStyle's button order.
    
    
API INCOMPATIBILITIES

    o Removed deprecated methods from the ButtonBarBuilder class:
      #addGriddedNarrow(JButton)
      #addGriddedNarrowButtons(JButton[])
      #addGriddedGrowingNarrow(JComponent)
    

NEW FEATURES
    
    o Moved DefaultFormBuilder and I15dPanelBuilder to the core.
    o FormLayout is serializable.
    o AbstractFormBuilder#appendLabelComponentGapColumn()
    o AbstractFormBuilder#appendParagraphGapRow()
    o AbstractFormBuilder#setComponentFactory(...) now public
    o I15dPanelBuilder#addI15dLabel(String, CellConstraints, 
                                    Component, CellConstraints)
    o LayoutStyle#getTabbedDialogMarginX()
    o LayoutStyle#getTabbedDialogMarginY()
    o LayoutStyle#getButtonBarPad()
    o LayoutStyle#isLeftToRightButtonOrder()
    o FormFactory#LABEL_COMPONENT_COLSPEC
    o MacLayoutStyle
    o AbstractFormBuilder#createLeftAdjustedConstraints(int)
    o ColumnSpec#decodeSpecs(String encodedColumnSpecs) (final)
    o RowSpec#decodeSpecs(String encodedRowSpecs) (final)
    o FormSpec.DefaultAlignment now visible (final)
    o Borders.EmptyBorder provides methods for the 4 sizes.
    
    
BUGS FIXED

    o PanelBuilder fails to build right-to-left if column span > 1.
    o DefaultFormBuilder fails to build right-to-left if column span > 1.
    o Deserialization fails in 1.0.3 preview.
    
    
KNOWN ISSUES

    o In some cases components that span multiple columns/rows 
      can expand the container size, although none of the spanned
      columns/rows are allowed to grow. See the FAQ for details.
      
 
OTHER CHANGES

    o Code:     Added safety check for invalid constraints in PanelBuilder
                #add(JLabel, CellConstraints, Component, CellConstraints)
                #add(String, CellConstraints, Component, CellConstraints)
    o Code:     DefaultComponentFactory#setTextAndMnemonic(JLabel) now private
    o Code:     DefaultUnitConverter refers indirectly to ToolKit#getFontMetrics
    o Code:     Marked ButtonStackBuilder#addGriddedNarrow as deprecated
    o JavaDocs: Extended and corrected 
    o JavaDocs: Clarified some semantics
    o Docs:     Fixed spelling and grammar errors
    o Docs:     Extended and reorganized the FAQ
    o Tutorial: Improved alignment texts in custom row and custom areas example
    o Tutorial: Added ButtonOrderExample
    o Tutorial: Added ComponentOrientationExample
    o Tutorial: Added OrientationUtils to ComponentOrientationExample

                    JGoodies Forms, Version 1.0.2
                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This release is a maintenance update that fixes bugs, comes with 
    a new example and a slightly improved and extended documentation.



DISTRIBUTION CHANGES

    o Added a list of FAQ.
    o Added JavaDoc version tags to all class comments.



NEW FEATURES
    
    o DefaultUnitConverter provides bound Bean properties for the 
      default dialog font and the average character width test string.


 
BUGS FIXED

    o Fixed broken button font lookup in DefaultUnitConverter
      that failed to find a font for GTKLookAndFeel, and more
      generally, SynthLookAndFeel subclasses.
    o Fixed #minimumLayoutSize that measured components that span
      multiple columns/rows with the preferredSize, now the minimumsize.
    o Patched the container expansion forced by components that span
      multiple columns/rows for the case that no column or row can grow.
      This expansion shall be performed if and only if the component spans
      an area that can grow. The old behavior performed this action ALWAYS;
      the patch check whether A column/row can grow; 
      the upcoming fix  will check the growing behavior of the spanned area.
      This problem is reflected by the FormLayout unit tests, where currently
      one out of three tests fails, see FormLayoutTests.test*ExtraExpansion*

    o Main:     Removed the final marker from FormDebugPanel; 
                see the class comment for details

    o Tutorial: Added example for custom areas with DefautFormBuilder
    o Tutorial: Changed some text field widths from 'default' to 'min'
    o Tutorial: Corrected frame titles
    o Tests:    Added tests for components that span multiple columns
